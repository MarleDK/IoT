# IoT authentication protocol
This is a proof of concept of a protocol for authentication.

## Requirements 
- NodeJS installed on a IOT device to run the "pi" code
- An android phone to run the "app" code
- NodeJS installed on a computer to run the "server" code

## Preparations
- Change the code in "app" to point to the IP-address of the server
- From the folder ".../IoT/server/" run the following command in a command line: "npm install" on the server
- From the folder ".../IoT/pi/" run the following command in a command line: "npm install" on the IOT device


## Running
- From the folder ".../IoT/server/" run the following command in a command line: "npm start" on the server
- From the folder ".../IoT/pi/" run the following command in a command line: "npm start" on the IOT device
- Run the Android app on the phone.
